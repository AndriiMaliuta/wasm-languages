# Kotlin hello world in a browser

**Warning : highly experimental status**

This sample leverages Kotlin/Wasm and V8 with its Wasm GC, typed function references and exception handling proposals.

Make sure to use Chrome Canary (unstable) for this sample. May require those flags:
`google-chrome-unstable --js-flags="--experimental-wasm-gc --experimental-wasm-typed-funcref --experimental-wasm-eh"`.
